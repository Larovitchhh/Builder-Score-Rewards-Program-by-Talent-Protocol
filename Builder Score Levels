To make the Builder Score more actionable, Talent Protocol categorizes scores into six levels, each representing a stage of building activity:Level 1: Novice (0–39): Beginners with basic account connections.
Level 2: Apprentice (40–79): Sporadic builders starting to make an impact.
Level 3: Practitioner (80–119): Established builders with notable contributions.
Level 4: Advanced (120–169): Builders with impressive projects and growing reputation.
Level 5: Expert (170–249): Top builders with exceptional track records.
Level 6: Master (250+): Highly accomplished builders with significant ecosystem impact.

These levels unlock specific perks, such as:Discounted Basename registrations for Level 3+ builders.
Prioritized hackathon applications for Level 4+ builders.
Automatic community membership for Level 2+ builders.

Builders can also mint onchain level badges to showcase their achievements, which remain in their collection even if their score fluctuates.
